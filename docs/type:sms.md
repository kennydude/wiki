# SMS Type

This is a fake "SMS" conversation thing. An example:

```
---
type: sms
Bob: bob.jpg
Mary: mary.jpg
---
Bob: Hi!
Mary: how r u?
Bob: Please learn how to type properly!!!!
Mary: ?
Bob: .__.
```

This is describing where to find pictures of the people in the conversation,
and their conversation.

This also has a list of stylesheets in `assets/sms` and are easily switched
between.
